# facial-recognition

describe enhancments of the models
marks position over the face (can be modified to improve accuracy)
train with the image and not take the marks into account (to use with face alignment software)

explain the architecture choices
why use transfer learning

transfert learning:
previous experiences
build from past experiences to make it easier to learn new things

convolution nn 
basic shape detectors
keep the first layers and apply the learning to the new layers

make it grey

fine tunig 

in depth analysis of the confusion matrix

explain the expressions based on the parameters
thnik about the general and random examples (out of the training dataset)

class imbalance with svm on orange canvas

what about identity recognition
dangerous points and why it has security issues


Keras API



Idea
4 problems : posing, lighting, expression, resolution
in vr headset filming we can remove the posing problem and resolution problem, the ligthing can be managed by converting to greyscale
so we can focus on the expressions and use them as a input for the headset. 

run loop to find the best parameter
use the confusion matrix to find the best parameters

error corrections like packet imports and installation
